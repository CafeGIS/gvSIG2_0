    <td>My trip to Spain and Morocco was made possible by the International Planetarium Society conference in Valencia. I attended this conference for work, then toured Barcelona, Casablanca, Marrakech, Fes, and Madrid. My traveling companion was my friend Pram, who was on a world tour and came down from Amsterdam to meet me.</td>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I took a night flight to Madrid that left JFK at about 8 PM. We arrived in Madrid the following morning where I had a short lay-over before flying on to Valencia.</p>

<p>I was shocked by the quality of the food in the Madrid airport. Puts many restaurants in the U.S. to shame and is an indication of how complacent the average U.S. consumer about the quality of the food available to them.</p>

    <td><p>Val&egrave;ncia is the third largest city in Spain with about 800,000 inhabitants. I was traveling there for a <a href="http://www.cac.es/ips2004/">meeting</a> of the <a href="http://www.ips-planetarium.org/">International Planetarium Society</a>, which worked well as the cost of traveling to Europe and back could be expensed. I flew directly to Madrid from JFK in New York and then took a smaller flight to Val&egrave;ncia, which took about an hour.</p>

<p>Our conference was in <a href="http://www.cac.es/">la Ciudad de las Artes y las Ci&egrave;ncies</a> and occupied much of my time. This afforded few opportunities to explore the city center, which is about a 15-minute bus ride away. However, by the end of the conference, I was making more of an effort to venture into town and explore the bars and discos by night.</p>

<p>Val&egrave;ncia does seem to be heading in the right direction, though one still sees the sales pitch in the tourist brochures that suggest some level of desperation. Val&egrave;ncia remains overshadowed by the more popular tourist destinations of Madrid and Barcelona. Still, Val&egrave;ncia is a nice city and, as it was my first exposure to Spain, I enjoyed the new food, the Spanish people, and the culture.</p></td>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.cac.es/umbracle/index.php">garden promenade</a> offers views of the of the planetarium and the science museum from above. The gardens have many palm trees, cacti, and flowering shrubs and vines. The entire length of the garden, which is about two-tenths of one mile, is covered in this barred design, which I hope will be covered by vines and purple flowers (such as you see here) one day. Since umbr&iacute;o or umbroso means shade, I expect there will be some of that here when the flora have time to mature.</p>

The sweeping arc that hangs above the giant theater is a pleasure to look at. I'm not too sure what's going on with the lower half of the building though. Inside will be an 1,800 seat theater accompanied by a 2,100 seat outdoor theater. I would like to have seen the inside of this place.</p>

<p>Pram and I had some time to kill before jumping on the train to Barcelona. We walked over to the old square, ran into Miguel, Pram's friend, and then walked to the train station.</p>

			<name>View From El Micalet</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ryan and I climbed the 200 steps for a view of Val&egrave;ncia and the Plaza de la Reina below. I was surprised to see parking below the square. One reads about these squares being centuries old, then you see a parking garage below them. This is a common scene in Spain, though, and a smart use of space. This square was the heart of old Val&egrave;ncia before the city expanded in the 19th century.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R4-017-7.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="View from El Micalet" /></p>

<p>Ryan posing with Valencia (background). The Mediterranean Sea is visible between buildings on the horizon. The bells are right beside and below us. They are very proud of their <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2894110-miguelete_el_valencia-i">bells</a>, listing each of them on the ticket along with their weight and year of acquisition. The oldest is Jaime which dates from 1440; the heaviest is Miguel-Vicente which weighs in at 11,000 kilograms (that's over 24,000 pounds for us non-metric folks!). The tower's total height is 70 meters (230 feet) to the tippy-top.</p>

<p>Looking toward the City of the Arts and Sciences. The Palace of the Arts and the Museum of the Sciences are seen in the distance, center frame. Farther are the shipyards on the Med. My hotel is among the cluster of taller buildings to the right of the City of the Arts and Sciences.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was surprised by the alabaster windows in this cathedral. If you look closely, you can see the dark imperfections in the thinly-carved sheets of stone (barely detectable in this photo). This produces a bright, airy feeling inside which I found to be pleasant, as opposed to stained glass windows that, while beautiful, keep the inside quite dark.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the last day of the conference, I toured some museums with two fellow planetarians from Wisconsin. This is the main hallway inside the museum; to the right are the exhibit floors. This is a very hands-on museum. Our favorite was the Matrix-like photo shoot where you get in the center of a ring that's equipped with a camera every meter. The woman tells you to go on the count of three and then the cameras start snapping in sequence. After, you get to see the whole 360-degree shot, Matrix style. Chris (on the right) had the best pose with his legs up and his arm out like a fierce cat. The woman taking the pictures was amused and laughed for some time at our picture.</p>

    <td><p>I became enamored with Barcelona's architecture, its friendly people, its rich history, and its insane nightlife. I hope to return soon to this city by the sea.</p>

<p>We stayed in a <a href="http://www-ma2.upc.es/~geomc/events/socg2002/infoHGD.html">hotel</a> right off the <a href="http://www.vfks.de/treffen2003/barcelona/bb/Image37.html">Plaza de Catalunya</a>, the city's main square. I tried to strike a balance between seeing the city and going out and partying. I partly believe that I can party anywhere, so why should I travel 1,000 miles to do so. On the other hand, I also think this is the best way meet the locals. I tried to be somewhat disciplined though, getting in before 7 in the morning. One could easily stay out later; I believe Pram rolled in around 9 or 10 some mornings. </p>

<p>Our typical day involved waking up&#8212;early if we didn't stay out too late, early afternoon if we did&#8212;and seeing some sights. We ate a late lunch (the Spanish way) with a few courses and some wine, then continued to see the sights until it was time to get ready for the evening. Around midnight, one goes to the bars for a nice chat with new friends; the discos come to life around 3 A.M. My nocturnal tendencies were completely (and overly) satisfied here.</p></td>

			<name>Viaduct</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>As wonderful as this viaduct looks, it is actually a 1920s add-on. This overpass is on Calle de Bisbe and connects the Casa de los Can&oacute;nigos, built in the 15th century, with the Generalitat. What I'm curious about is why, after these two buildings sat side by side for centuries, was there a need to connect them one story above the ground. Curious...</p>

Here we discovered where the hookers dally with the drunks of Barcelona. Upon discovering this, we decided to seek a more beaten path and went back to La Rambla.</p>

			<name>On Las Ramblas</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Las Ramblas is a wide avenue that runs from the seaside into the relatively newer parts of town in L'Eixample. The name comes from the arabic word for sand, <em>ramla</em>. This avenue traces the path of a river that was dry and sandy in the summer. Merchants would use the dry riverbed to conduct business and sell their wares until the mid 1300s, when it was paved and became a more permanent marketplace. Today the avenue is divided into two-lanes for cars in each direction that surround the wide walkway up the middle. On the walkway are newsstands, cafes, and a lot of pet shops (where birds are the big seller). Each section has a speciality and is known for something different. Along the way are many street performers, such as this tree guy behind Pram. Many of the performers strive for a motionless day, emulating the stone-carved monuments in Barcelona, but the tree guy would move his hands and head in slow-motion as a tree might. He was an original.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Cafe Dietrich is best known for their weekend show. It begins somewhere around 1 or 2 in the morning so people begin piling into the place after 1 AM.</p>

<p>People gathered beside a glassed-in room to see the upcoming show, but it never happened. I just talked with people on the periphery rather than inject myself into the dense crowd.</p>

<p>Pram and I met this Asian guy from Boston and a Swiss who works for HP in Barcelona who fancied Pram.</p>

<p>By 3 AM, Dietrich is closing. This is about when the discos begin ramping up, so we went to this place Metro a few blocks away with our new-found friends.</p>

			<name>Metro Disco</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Metro is one of the most popular discos in town. We arrived sometime after 3 AM (on the 11th actually) and it was just starting to come to life. One person from San Sebastian took an immediate liking to me: nice , but not my type. We talked for over an hour.</p>

<p>By about 5:30 I began hunting for Pram and finally tracked him down. Told him I was heading back; he stayed for awhile longer.</p>

<p>When I stepped outside, there was a thunderstorm. It wasn't raining too hard, though, so I made my way back to the hotel. Actually, I was hoping I knew where the hotel was. Even after a night of partying, I still made it back without getting lost.</p>

<p>After the exuberance of this night, I actually had the energy to write in my journal when I got home. But, by 6:45, I decided to go to sleep. I think Pram rolled in about 9 this morning.</p>

<p align="right">10 July 2004</p>

<p>Revisited the Metro on Monday night. I met someone from Paris and he and I talked about politics, Morocco, and Spain.</p>

<p>Metro has a show this evening, but it was to crowded, not to mention the fact that I couldn't understand much of what was being said. I left the crowd behind and ran into Pascal, Ryan's friend from Valencia, how surprising!</p>

<p>I left about 5:15 and found Pram home when I got there.</p>

			<name>La Sagrada Familia</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Opinions vary widely on the Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia cathedral and its architect, Antoni Gaud&iacute; i Cornet. Born in 1852, Gaud&iacute; started the cathedral in 1882 and had not completed half of the marvelous temple before being run over by a street car in 1926. As for my opinion, I wholeheartedly love it and, while it may not be easy to compare to other cathedrals, it certainly can stand alone as a magnificent work of art.</p>

			<name>The Passion Facade</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Passion Facade of La Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia was completed after Gaud&iacute;'s death by architect Jordi Bonet and sculptor Josep Subirachs. Plans for the cathedral were mostly destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, when many cathedrals and churches were burnt. Thankfully, this cathedral survived, but Gaud&iacute;'s workshop was burned and his tomb in the cathedral's crypt was vandalized. Architects are now combining what remains from Gaud&iacute;'s original plans with their own styles to complete the massive project. Sponsors hope that the cathedral will be completed by the centenary of Gaud&iacute;'s death in 2026.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The stained glass in La Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia is very modern in its colors and forms. While I'm used to seeing stories depicted in the glass, here there seem to be no discernible characters or stories. There are some words, though, in the smaller circular windows.</p>

<p>The nave of the cathedral. Gaud&iacute;'s architectural vision was inspired by nature, exhibited here by the concrete forest with a partially complete ceiling. Note the balcony at the bottom.</p>

<p>The interior of the cathedral is completely filled with scaffolding. This was an amazing sight in and of itself. The looming Mother Teresa is a sign for a photographic exhibit on her life and work, which was also quite moving.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Facade of the Nativity was completed in Gaud&iacute;'s vision (he had completed one of the four towers before his death). Each of the three facades of the cathedral will have four towers, each tower dedicated to one of the 12 apostles. Thus far, the Facade of the Nativity and the Facade of the Passion are complete, the Facade of the Glory, the main entrance on Calle Mallorca, will someday sprout another four towers. In the center will be a massive, 575-foot tower symbolizing Christ.</p>

			<name>Barcelona Cathedral</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Gothic cathedral in Barcelona is said to be the darkest cathedral in Europe, and it is indeed dark inside even with help from artificial lighting. This beautiful cathedral boasts, among other things, to have the crucifix from the mast of Don Juan's ship from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.</p>

			<name>Cathedral Cloister</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the green, medieval cloister built in 1385. The geese have been here as long as anyone can remember. When my grandfather visited this cathedral in 1976, he too snapped a photo of the gaggle, which was presumably composed of elder relatives. The fountain is covered in moss with palms and plants surrounding this little oasis.</p>

<p>We entered the cathedral from the side and came upon this beautiful cloister. Here, one can peer through the palms to see the great octagonal cathedral tower.</p>

			<name>Cathedral Roof</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The view east from the Cathedral rooftop terrace. The cathedral is in the Barri G&ograve;tic, said to be the best example of a medieval city in Europe. Two things struck me from this rooftop view. While I know the church is more powerful in Spain than in America, the number of cathedrals and churches within blocks of this mighty cathedral is incredible. I was also surprised by the presence of TV antennas. Clearly, satellite and cable has not hit it big here, further adding to Barcelona's charm.</p>

<p>The grand chapel tower, thankfully not encased in scaffolding as the entire front facade is.</p>

<p>Toward the north, La Sagrada Fam&iacute;lia is a conspicuous feature of the skyline. In the distance are the foothills, surrounding the city like a Hollywood stage set.</p>

			<name>Cathedral Apse (interior)</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The front of the cathedral with the altar and the crypt below. In the alabaster crypt is Saint Eul&agrave;lia, a 14-year-old girl who was martyred in the 4th century. The oldest part of this church is the right transept, dating from 1298. Before this mighty cathedral was built, there sat two other churches on this site. The first was destroyed when al-Mansur raided the city in 985. The second, a Romanesque church, was built by Count Ram&oacute;n Berenguer I, who campaigned against the Moors in the 11th century. Two doorways survive from this church.</p>

			<name>Palau de la Musica</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the Modernista-style music palace. Built in 1908, this ornate building is crammed onto the narrow Sant Pere M&eacute;s Alt alleyway. Because the street is so narrow, it's impossible to get a picture of the entire facade without attaching a fisheye lens to your camera.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R2-005-1.jpg" width="294" height="450"  alt="Palau de la M&uacute;sica" /></p>

<p>With its mixture of red brick, wild tile mosaics, and this figurehead sculpture on the corner, this building could be considered a work of art or an assault on the eye. I like the flashy look, myself. I won't soon forgive myself for chopping off the top of the corner sculpture though.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the main entrances to the park features this lovely elevated vista above a large fountain. This park was a sore spot for Catalans until it was used for the Universal Exhibition. When Philip V conquered Catalunya in 1714, he moved the university that once stood here out of Barcelona and built a massive fortification. In 1869, the land was sold back to the city. Part of it became this park and the rest was used for housing to finance the razing of the fortification's walls.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm having trouble deciding if I like this place or not. Could I live in this house? I like the many inventive functional designs, the ventilation slats in the wood and the use of light, but I'm not sure I like the overall style. I wonder if Se&ntilde;or Batll&oacute; did.</p>

<p>In the center of the house is the light well, a giant sky light that spans all floors of the house. As the floors reach to the roof, the window size shrinks allowing less light in the upper floors, thereby keeping them cooler.</p>

As we taxied to the terminal in the bus, many of us saw a suitcase sitting on the tarmac that had fallen out of a bag carrier train. Laughter spread throughout the bus, but we all realized that some poor bastard will do without their clothes tonight.</p>

    <td><p>From Barcelona, we took a plane to Madrid then connected to Casablanca. The flight from Madrid to Casablanca is about an hour and a half, but Morocco is two hours behind Spain. Now, instead of 6 hours ahead of New York, we were only 4 hours ahead. </p>

<p>Once we arrived at the airport, we rented a car and drove into the city. This city is almost impossible to navigate as there aren't many street signs and the entire city naming system is undergoing <a href="http://french.about.com/library/graphics/streetsign.jpg">arabization</a>. Even Royal decrees have played a part in swapping names around town. Add to this confusion the chaotic driving and the fact that we were leading a two-car caravan filled with people we had met on the plane, and it quickly became a nightmare. In the end, we picked up someone off the street who, after some confusion, ably led us to our <a href="http://www.traveltop10.com/top%2010/crowne86.htm">hotel</a>. I'd always heard people in Morocco were extremely generous; however, we were putting this to the test sooner than I'd hoped.</p>

<p>While I hate to disparage any place, both Pram and I did not care for Casablanca too much. So much so that within hours of arriving we canceled our second night and decided to head to Marrakech the following morning. But, Casablanca will forever be my first impression of the Muslim world. We spent the remains of our day on a long <a href="./images/casablancamap-path.jpg">walking tour</a>, from the Crowne Plaza to the medina, through Casablancan slums and around the glorious Hassan II Mosque, then back through the center of town.</p></td>

Without much in the way of street signs, we finally resorted to asking a stranger on the street, who jumped in our car and guided us to the hotel. I was not comfortable with this, but Pram didn't seem to have a problem.</p>

			<name>Palace Mohammed V</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The royal palace for King Mohammed V, who was the sultan when he was exiled to Madagascar by the French in 1953. France was trying to cope with a nationalist movement in Morocco and viewed Mohammed V as too sympathetic to the cause. Mohammed V returned two years later and on March 2, 1956, the French pulled out of Morocco. Mohammed V would become king in 1957 and prime minister in 1960 before dying suddenly a year later.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Entry to the Casablanca medina, a maze of streets and alleys that make up the oldest section of the city. We had no idea where we were going and did not know what this would be like, but we ventured in regardless. If a choice was before us, we always took the wider, more traveled street.</p>

<p>I can't say we were greeted with open arms in the medina. Around each corner we were stared at and we saw no other tourists. We were alone, and we stood out.</p><p>15 July 2004</p>]]></description>

We went to stand in front of the cafe on this corner where two police were sitting, but they did nothing. Finally, people from the medina came out and convinced him to leave us alone.</p>

<p>At no time was I frightened of this person, I was just frustrated that he would not leave us alone.</p><p>15 July 2004</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pram used the bathroom at this gas station. Once again, it was the hole in the floor variety. We were walking in a local neighborhood at this point. I felt pretty safe, but after coming out of the medina, where everyone was staring at us, perhaps the wide-open streets here give us the illusion of safety.</p><p>15 July 2004</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second-largest mosque in the world. It is, by far, the most pristine part of Casablanca, and perhaps all of Morocco. It holds 25,000 inside and another 80,000 outside on the plaza. Today is Thursday and the plaza is filled with couples taking a stroll before the day of prayer tomorrow. It is a peaceful place.</p>

		<name>Casablanca to Marrakech</name>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Our drive from Casablanca to Marrakech was not too pleasant. We had the usual problem getting out of the Casablanca; adding at least 30 minutes spent lost in the streets of the city. We also stopped by the Casablanca airport to ask the car rental guys about the red, exclamation point light that appeared on our dashboard this morning (out of brake fluid, that's all).</p>

<p>I was hoping for a four-lane highway to Marrakech, but I was too optimistic; the road is two-lane and very crowded. While the distance is only 150 miles, it took about 4 hours, dodging <a href="http://www.ultimatejourney.com/TruckOverload.JPG">over-packed trucks</a>, buses with people hanging from the doors, <a href="http://www.travelnorthafrica.com/images/petitTaxi.jpg">taxis</a> going from town to town, and wealthy, Moroccan sports car drivers.</p>

    <td><p>After hours of driving south from Casablanca, we came upon a huge congregation of adobe buildings in the distance. The haze hanging over the flat, sub-Saharan plain was daunting. I don't precisely know what my impression of Marrakech was before I arrived there, but it's safe to say that whatever they were, they were wholly wrong. Marrakech is not the European-like city of Casablanca, rather, it appears like an oversized oasis in the middle of the desert. The red-orange buildings reflect the hue of the surrounding earth and, aside from the minarets sprinkled around town, none appear to be over three stories tall.</p></td>

			<name>First hotel rejected</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our first stop in Marrakech was at the Sheraton. The prices here were high, but more importantly it was out in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>The hotel is filled with French families who flew down to Marrakech to sit by a pool inside a compound.</p>

<p>We picked up a small map and now had our bearings.</p>

			<name>Pulled Over</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This was the first time we were pulled over for speeding. Pram skillfully begged his way out of the 400 dirham (about 45 USD) fee, which must be paid on the spot.</p>

<p>Once in the city, We parked the car just inside the medina and walked around looking for a place to stay. At times we were guided, other times we were on our own. We ended up splurging for a nice <a href="http://www.lesjardinsdelakoutoubia.com/">resort hotel</a> that cost a lot, but was a nice refuge from the bustling city.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Having just left the cops, we drove toward the medina. Somehow we found this parking lot, where we decided to park the car and look for a place to stay on foot.</p>

<p>When we parked, the attendant came up and wanted to show us a few places. I was skeptical, but Pram was willing to see what happened.</p>

<p>He took us to a few Riads (Riads are the traditional Moroccan homes with interior gardens), but we wanted to keep looking.</p>

<p>Once we got back to the car, he tried to extract cash from us. We gave him some, but he demanded more. I, being naive, was trying to talk to this person; Pram just kept telling me to get in the car. I finally did and Pram did too. And they let us out of the parking lot without.</p>

I engaged the young (and more progressive) receptionist in discussions in world politics, the future of Morocco,  and what his everyday life is like. Really nice guy.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a five-star hotel and the gardens in the courtyard were a welcoming sight after trouncing around the hot, dirty, noisy, smelly <a href="http://telsat.belspo.be/whp/Marrakech/marrakech-description.html">medina</a> all day.</p>

<p>A fireplace in our hotel. Looks like the fires occasionally get too big.</p>

<p>Between the time we made a deal on the room and picked up our luggage, they had come in and prepared the room with scented air, made beds, and deposited these flower petals in our bathroom. Needless to say, the petals did not last long.</p>

			<name>Koutoubia Mosque</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is one of the largest mosques in town with a 230-foot high minaret. It was built in the 1100s by the newly empowered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohades">Almohads</a>, the ruling Muslim Berber dynasty whose kingdom encompassed much of modern day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Muslim Spain. Each side of this minaret is different, providing a classic example of Moroccan and Andalucian architecture. The minaret used to be covered with painted plaster and colored tilework, but this has all been removed. All that appears from the modern era is the loudspeaker at the top that calls people to prayer five time a day.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A nice connecting road between the Rue Riad Zitoun el-Qedim and Rue Riad Zitoun el-Jedid. We had parked the car and were wandering around through the medina looking for a place to stay when we came upon this nice scene. Both of us were hoping we could find our way back to the car. We did.</p>

<p>Directly opposite from the previous picture, we wanted a picture of this door. The man beside Pram moved to the side, but Pram motioned him to be in the picture if he liked. I have no idea what this place is. It could be religious or it could be a hotel.</p>

			<name>Weaving</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Weaving in Morocco is always done by hand and always by boys and men. We had met a store owner nearby and he started talking to us. He had been to New York and, it turns out, his brother lives in New York and, as he put it, "never comes home." Always going to some place called Fire Island, he said. Pram and I just looked at one another. This guy took us to a house where we watched these boys and men weaving. He told us of the high profile fashion types who place orders with him. Even sent someone to another house to get an eight-by-ten of him with these famous fashion people. He seemed nice though. This was one of a half-dozen textile manufacturers we toured in Morocco. Imagine doing this 8 hours a day.</p>

			<name>Souq (Market)</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We stumbled upon this spice market inside one of the many <em>qissarias</em>, or covered markets. It was so visually stunning that it stopped us dead in our tracks. Each of these conical towers is a powdered spice. Below them are buckets of incense (front), cinnamon, and mint tea, to name a few.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R5-047-22.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Spice Souq" /></p>

<p>Pram gets a lesson in pouring spices.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R2-16.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="Heapin' Spices" /></p>

<p>Now that Pram had had his picture taken, the spice man told me I had to have one too. He seemed like a nice enough guy, kept telling Pram and me he also does massage. Not exactly sure what his intentions were with that. The people of Morocco are not afraid of physical contact the way people are in the West. It is common to see men holding hands in the streets here. Boys all the way up to old men. It seems as though the one taboo here is for unmarried women and men to be physically intimate in public, but boys, no problem. It is also forbidden by law to have an unmarried man and woman share a hotel room, but two men, no problem. Of course, sex between men is punishable.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the edge of the medina, where Avenue Houmane el-Fetouaki meets Rue Riad Zitoun el-Qedim is this small square. The main mode of transportation seems to be these <a href="http://www.elvisthefish.com/images/feature/morocco_speed.jpg">motor bikes</a>. These are the type you pedal to get going, then they go at a slow clip. <a href="http://www.stokely.org/20050105-morocco-marrakech/DPSCamera_0002.JPG">Taxis</a> are also very common in Morocco, as most people do not own cars.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I snapped this photo of the main square, called Djemma el-Fna, from our hotel roof. It's near sunset and the square is just getting going. Said to be one of the world's greatest spectacles, the Djemma el-Fna is a large square filled with activity, including food vendors that <a href="http://mirror-us-ga1.gallery.hd.org/_exhibits/places-and-sights/_more2002/_more11/Morocco-Marrakech-Djemaa-el-Fna-central-square-WL.jpg">send smoke into the air</a>, <a href="http://www.millhouse.nl/graphics/0310120.JPG">juice markets</a> with some of the best orange juice you'll taste, <a href="http://gallery.hd.org/_exhibits/places-and-sights/_more2002/_more11/Morocco-Marrakech-entertainers-in-main-square-WL.jpg">performing musicians</a> in outlandish costume, <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/jeff_veitch/images/scans5/moroc18.jpg">snake charmers</a>, <a href="http://www.hanshendriksen.net/pics/mar/mar10.htm">performing monkeys</a>, and a large <a href="http://www.skiouros.net/voyages/2002/maroc/ma2002_17.html">crowd</a> to support it all. After passing through the square a few times, I came to dread it a bit. I took no pictures in the square as you are hounded the moment you get near any of the square dwellers. From this vantage point, I can hear the music of the snake charmers, the beating of drums, and a cheering crowd.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R5-E101.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="Djemma el-Fna&#8212;The Square" /></p>

<p>After a hot, 100-degree day, the sun is finally setting. Not the best sunset I've seen, but pretty nonetheless. Here, from the roof of the hotel, one can see the neighboring buildings, many falling apart but with satellite dishes mounted on the roof. In a minute or two, when it's officially sunset, we'll be hearing from our neighbors praying over the loudspeakers again.</p>

<p>Sunset from the hotel roof. A telephoto lens would have been perfect here, but, alas, I have to settle for the 70-mm view. Sunset is when Marrakech wakes up. The streets become packed with people, the square turns into a hive of activity, and people jam the many caf&eacute;s in town. The daytime is too hot.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Said to be one of the world's greatest spectacles, the Djemma el-Fna is a large square filled with activity, including food vendors that <a href="http://mirror-us-ga1.gallery.hd.org/_exhibits/places-and-sights/_more2002/_more11/Morocco-Marrakech-Djemaa-el-Fna-central-square-WL.jpg">send smoke into the air</a>, <a href="http://www.millhouse.nl/graphics/0310120.JPG">juice markets</a> with some of the best orange juice you'll taste, <a href="http://gallery.hd.org/_exhibits/places-and-sights/_more2002/_more11/Morocco-Marrakech-entertainers-in-main-square-WL.jpg">performing musicians</a> in outlandish costume, <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/jeff_veitch/images/scans5/moroc18.jpg">snake charmers</a>, <a href="http://www.hanshendriksen.net/pics/mar/mar10.htm">performing monkeys</a>, and a large <a href="http://www.skiouros.net/voyages/2002/maroc/ma2002_17.html">crowd</a> to support it all.</p>

<p>After passing through the square a few times, I came to dread it a bit. I took no pictures in the square as you are hounded the moment you get near any of the square dwellers. From this vantage point, I can hear the music of the snake charmers, the beating of drums, and a cheering crowd.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We walked up into the new town on the Ave Mohammed V. It was close to 100 degrees and the sun was roasting my arms and face.</p>

<p>We took some shelter in a sidewalk cafe near here. A policeman and his wife or girlfriend were sitting nearby on his lunch hour. We had some orange juice, water, and ice cream.</p>

			<name>Al Fassia Restaurant</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere near here is Al Fassia, a restaurant we frequented. The food is all cooked by women.</p>

<p>We arrived at about 9 PM and the place was packed. We waited a half-hour for a table. We ended up sitting beside a French family. She spoke English, but her husband did not. Their kid fell asleep. We chatted for awhile about our travels around the world and what to see in Morocco.</p>

			<name>Along Road N8</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We begin with our drive from Marrakech to Fes. Starting in the low desert around Marrakech at an elevation of 1,500 feet, we skirted the High Atlas mountains as we drove northeast to Fes. Some of the distant peaks reach over 4,000 meters (over 13,000 feet). Along the way we passed through many towns, several <em>wilayats</em>, or provinces, and lost our way a few times (which should surprise no one by now).</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Outside Marrakech, near here on the N8 road; I decided to take a few shots of the country through the car window. This is a hut beside a farm. The climate is very arid here so I'm not sure what they grow. We did see a lot of olive trees and cactus groves, where they harvest the fruit for eating, but that was about it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Up on a plateau of sorts, we continue to climb toward Fes. Here it is much drier and vegetation is more sparse. Pictured is our tiny Nissan Micra that got us around Morocco for a week. It was a decent car with air conditioning, but it did not enjoy going over 60 miles per hour.</p>

<p>I think the heat is getting to someone... I want to know what the graffiti means on this sign, turning the town of <em>Azilal</em> into <em>Bazigar</em>.</p>

			<name>Ifrane, Morocco</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>At over 5,000 feet in elevation, Ifrane is a respite from the hot desert we traveled through earlier today. In the winter, this is a ski resort, like a transplanted town from the Alps.</p>

<p>Ifrane has a very Western flavor. There is the Al-Akhawayan University, an English language private college where many of the instructors are American. It is a vacation spot for families who want to visit the closest thing to an alpine town in Morocco. And, the King's summer residence is here. All because of the cool climate.</p>

    <td><p>Fes is the great imperial city of Morocco. Founded in the 800s, it remains the lifeblood of the country. Fes is altogether different from both Casablanca and Marrakech. Tucked between the Middle Atlas and Rif mountain ranges, the city is more compact than other large cities in the country.</p>

<p>We arrived in Fes and were quickly picked up by a faux tour guide who was on his motor bike. He showed us to some hotels in New Fes, but it was too far from the Fes el-Bali medina. He then took us to a riad just inside the walls of the medina, the <a href="http://www.darmasmoudi.ma/">Dar Masmoudi</a>, where we decided to stay.</p>

<p>The entire <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170">Fes el-Bali (Old Fes) medina</a> is a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. It contains nearly 10,000 narrow streets and alleys covering 740 acres (100 acres smaller than Central Park in New York City). Within this medieval medina live about 160,000 people, 223 people per acre or 142,454 people per square mile. Compare that to the highest population density areas in New York (<a href="http://www.gorzow.mm.pl/~bebelebe/Upper%20East%20Side%20of%20Manhattan,%20New%20York.jpg">Upper East Side</a>) that are around 100,000 people per square mile. And, since most buildings are <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/jean-claude.lejout/maroc/DSCF1210.jpg">under four stories</a> in Fes el-Bali, the population density in Fes is all the more meaningful than in New York, where we have 40-story apartment buildings.</p></td>

			<name>Hammam (Public Baths)</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pram in the <em>hammam</em>, or public bath. We visited this bath on the evening of our arrival. According to our tour guide, it is over 350 years old. Hammams typically have a room for changing, such as the one pictured, then a series of rooms, each warmer than the last until reaching the back room, which is a sauna. In this back room are two tubs of water, one hot and the other cold. Here, you rinse with hot water and lie on the floor to allow the steam to loosen your muscles. Buckets are provided to scoop the water out and take it to the next room where you wash. We had someone wash and massage us, then shampoo us. After rinsing off, you go to the next room to cool off before retrieving your clothes in the changing room. Men, modestly, do not take it all off, but typically wear bikini underwear.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R2-30.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="The Hammam" /></p>

<p>Peaking in another doorway, we were shown how the water is heated for the hammams. In this room was a small street-level room with a cot and about 6 cats sleeping. Below ground, this man was taking wood chips and shavings from this pile and putting them in the fire. The huge oven lies under the tank that holds the hot water in the steam room of the hammam.</p>

			<name>Riad Dar Masmoudi</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>After being stalked, we hooked up with our stalking faux guide. After several showings, we chose to stay in this  Riad inside the Fes medina.</p>

<p>Coming from the roof, I snapped this photo looking down on our Riad's courtyard from the second floor. We had just finished breakfast (pictured on the table) and our faux guide (sitting on the sofa) was about to take us out into Fes. Our room is through the door in the upper part of the frame. The intricate tilework, called <em><a href="http://www.darwish-studio.com/zel1.html">Zellij</a></em>, is influenced by mosaics of the Byzantines, Moorish Spain, and Arabs. It is forbidden to represent living things in the mosaics, only geometrical patterns, of which there are hundreds to choose from.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R3-033-15.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="In our Riad" /></p>

<p>Aside from the fact that I'm a white guy and Pram is an Asian guy, it is pretty easy to spot tourists here. Clothes are a dead give away. Most Moroccans would never wear t-shirts out in public, preferring collared shirts or the traditional <em>jellaba</em>, the full-length, kaftan-like garments. Many will wear short-sleeved shirts, but never shorts. I figure I'm going to stand out, so I may as well not put too much thought into fitting in. Pram had it worse than I, often we would come upon a group of young boys playing in the medina who would yell "Jackie Chan" at the first sight of him. I only gained the attention of people who assumed I was French and started speaking to me. If French didn't work, they would move on to Spanish and Italian, eventually making their way to English. When asked where I was from, I would always answer "New York."</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R2-33.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="Tourists" /></p>

<p>This was one of the staff members at our Riad. He seemed like a gentleman. He took us up to the roof, guided us from the Riad to nearby restaurants, and helped us with our luggage. Everyone in the Riad was quite nice, particularly the manager. He was a warm, thoughtful person. I could tell he was filled with faith and had a humble attitude toward life and those around him.</p>

<p>Fes started out as a small Berber settlement around the Oued (River) Fes. By the year 810, thousands of families escaping Al-Andalus in Spain had settled on the west bank of the river. Joining them on the east bank were Arabs from modern day Tunisia. These two groups settled in one medina called Fes el-Bali, or Old Fes. The second medina, Fes el-Jdid, or New Fes, was settled by Jews in the 14th century. Here, the Arab town is in the foreground and the Andalucian quarter is in the distance tucked into the base of the hills. Separating them still is the Oued Fes, a river that tunnels under much of the medina supplying water for the mosques, communal water fountains, and hammams.</p>

			<name>The Merenid Tombs</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Merenid Tombs are a remnant of the time when the Merenids ruled Morocco in the 14th Century. Built atop a hill, one can get a view of the whole city from here. The Merenids built New Fes, which served as their capitol. Soon thereafter, Europe came a-knockin' and the Portuguese and the Spanish soon overwhelmed local kingdoms to take pieces of the country.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R3-041-19.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Merenid Tombs" /></p>

<p>The view from the Merenid Tombs looking over the medina. The Old Fes medina has close to 10,000 maze-like alleyways that leave you confused, at best. The medina is surrounded by walls that date from the 1100s (the original walls were destroyed). There are about a dozen gates, called babs, that allow access to the medina. In the old days, the gates were closed at 9 o'clock; if you didn't make it in, you slept outside the city. And, back then, there wasn't a whole lot outside of the walls, aside from cemeteries.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R3-035-16.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="View From the Merenid Tombs" /></p>

<p>North of Fes there is little sign of civilization. In the distance are the Rif Mountains along with some olive groves, but no towns are visible. It amazed me that one side of this hill is packed with mud-brick buildings, seemingly piled on top of each other, while the opposite side of the hill could be hundreds of miles from anywhere.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What must be the Central Park of Fes, this is the nicest park in the city according to our guide. It was nice, but not too clean, and not the lush park I usually have in mind when I hear gardens. What makes this park special is that there are no parks in the medina; over 99 percent of the land in the medina is developed.</p>

			<name>Medersa as-Seffarine</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Medersas are colleges where students come to live and learn the ways of Islam and Muslim law. The Medersa as-Seffarine is the oldest in Fes, built in 1280, and, while the tilework and woodwork are amazing, it is in such a state of disrepair that I wonder where my 10 dirham is going.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R3-045-21.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Medersa as-Seffarine" /></p>

<p>View from one of the windows upstairs. The rooms upstairs are the residences for the students and look out on the open-air courtyard. The camera does not pick up the intricacies of the carved cedar. It is amazing.</p>

			<name>The Ceramic Co-op</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Because of the smoke and pollution, the ceramic factories are always on the outskirts of town. Rich in tradition, boys start apprenticing at a young age so that they can work in this respected Moroccan profession. Here we have two tracing out patterns on the ceramic tile. With a stencil, they paint a white outline on the tile, resulting in the painted tiles in the lower right. These will then be hand carved into individual pieces.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R3-5.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="Tracing Patterns" /></p>

<p>Here is another young man carving out small shapes from larger block tiles. The surrounding tile is carefully chipped away until the decorative piece remains. The decorative piece can be in the shape of a square, a diamond, a triangle, a hexagonal star, or other polygonal shapes. Rarely circular, though.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R3-6.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Young Carver" /></p>

<p>A room of chiselers, carving small tile pieces from large, glazed tiles. The small pieces are placed in piles and taken to another room where they are placed in a mosaic.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R3-8.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="Chiseling" /></p>

<p>Here these men are taking the carved tiles and building a mosaic from them. These are all done by memory; the pieces are upside down, hiding their color. Examples of their work can be seen everywhere in Morocco, on the walls, floors, tables, and public fountains and spaces.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is one of the dozen or so gates, or <em>babs</em>, to the medina. These are the only way in or out of the medina and few are wide enough to allow cars to pass. Much of the freight that is delivered from outside the city must be off-loaded onto donkey at these gates.</p>

			<name>Andalus Mosque</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pram and Eunice, our no-so-trusty guide, in front of the Andalus Mosque. We are now in the Andalus Quarter of the medina, where thousands of families fled the rule of Al-Andalus in the Cordoba region of Spain and settled here in the 9th century.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R3-9.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Andalus Mosque" /></p>

<p>The decorative entrance to the Andalus Mosque. This mosque was first built in 859 and later additions took place in 956, 1203-1207, and 1295-1296. This portal was among the later constructions and is made from carved stucco and colorful tiles with a carved cedar cornice (out of frame).</p>

			<name>Kairaouine Mosque</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the main mosque in Fes. Built between 859 and 862, the mosque is completely surrounded by buildings, belying the fact that it can hold over 20,000 people. Non-Muslims cannot enter, but we peeked through one of its many doors on a surrounding alley. The university inside is one of the most respected institutions for Muslim learning in the entire world, and has one of the finest libraries in the Muslim world. There are typically over 300 students in residence. In the distance are the Merenid Tombs atop the hill.</p>

			<name>Textile Mill</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the roof of the textile co-op. This is our trusty tour guide for the textile mill, where traditional Moroccan fabrics are made. We talked with this guy for some time. He lived in East Harlem for awhile before coming back to Morocco. We talked about politics, living in Fes, and, oh, about weaving.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R3-E051.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="The Textile Tour" /></p>

<p>Adjacent to the textile co-op is (apparently) the only double minaret in the world. The newer white tower is the standard mosque minaret. The closer tower was an observatory used by astronomers. In the history of astronomy, Arabs are credited with carrying astronomy through the Middle Ages, when there were not too many advances in Europe.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R6-005-1.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="The Double Minaret" /></p>

<p>In one of the rooms in the mill was this young one spinning. Apparently there are no chairs in Morocco.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R3-15.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="Young Weaver" /></p>

<p>Sales pressure. In the textile co-op where they sell <em>jellabas</em>, or kaftans, for men and women. I'm sporting a traditional jellaba, men always wear theirs long-sleeved, women wear the short-sleeved variety. How about that hat?</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/PRAM-R3-16.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Entering the Tannery" /></p>

<p>On another roof, this time to see the tannery, where leather is made. The techniques used in these tanneries have remained the same since medieval times. First, the hides come in and are stripped of their hair. Conditioned in the white tubs, they dry and then are dyed in the various colored tubs. Along the way, the leather is treated in, among other things, pigeon droppings and cow urine. Where does one get pigeon poop? "In the market," according to our guide. Seems like a logical place, I thought.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R6-011-4.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Tannery" /></p>

<p>I zoomed in to see the men working in the tannery. Pelts in various stages of the process are hanging in sheds, lying about drying, or being dyed in vats. The dyes are all natural, including indigo for blue, saffron for red, henna, and other plants.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Finally, we are back to the parking lot outside the Bab Jamai; our riad is just inside the medina walls. It was a long day filled with so many sights, sounds, and smells. I am completely drained. One more surprise was about to come from our lovable tour guide. He requested that we bestow him with something "western." He seemed to be leaning toward a shirt. Of course, all my shirts are completely plain, so he was leaning more on Pram for this and Pram was not happy about this. In the end, he gave him a shirt from Dickies, the clothing company, which Eunice put on straight away. It fit like the casing on a sausage.</p>

			<name>Pulled over (again)</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pram was pulled over again around here. He demanded we pay 400 DH and we had calculated our money pretty closely so we didn't have too many dirhams left.</p>

<p>Pram tried the Indonesian muslim connections and whipped out some "salamu lekum," but the cop was not buying it. The cop then peeked his head in the car and asked me where I was from. I replied, "New York." The cop responded, "Since you are English, I will give you a break." He dropped the fee to 200 DH. Pram had hidden 200 DH in the side pocket of the car door, so we told him we only had 160 DH, and Pram took all the money out of his wallet to prove it. The cop took our 160 DH and we were off.</p>

<p>We have 200 DH. Can we make it to Madrid?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Finally, a highway. We drove a 2-lane road toward Meknes, but then hooked up with the highway. The toll on the road was 32 DH, eating into our remaining dirhams.</p>

<p>The speed limit on the highway is 120 km/hr (75 mi/hr). No danger of getting pulled over here, our mini Nissan shudders at about 110 km/hr.</p>

<p>For the most part, the terrain from Fes to Rabat was grassy, rolling hills. Once at Rabat, we drove down the Atlantic coast to Casablanca.</p>

			<name>Hotel Azul (July 21)</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is where we stayed after visiting Marrakech ad Fes. We had one night in Casablanca and then we fly to Madrid. Of course, we were not too excited about coming back to Casablanca, but we would stay on the beach this time. Perhaps the change of scenery would be better than our experience a week ago.</p>

<p>The conditions of this hotel are what we've come to expect in Casablanca. Dirty carpets, old beds, and a sparkling lobby. We paid 724 DH for the room, but we would only be here for one night.</p>

<p>We are eager to get back to Spain.</p>

<p>The beer was good after a long day of driving. The food was not great.</p>

		<name>Casablanca to Madrid</name>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Woke up a bit late today. We rushed out the door and headed to the airport. We didn't have a lot of time to spend lost in Casablanca, and with our track record, that was a factor in getting to the airport today. Of course, we're taking Iberia Air, and they are always late.</p>

<p>We did get lost, but not for long. We returned the rental car and went to customs and security. After stamping my passport and wishing me well, one of the customs officers asked if I was in the military as I walked away. "No!" I answered.</p>

<p>Our next obstacle was security. You see, our plan involved carrying our luggage on the plane because we did not intend to take our connecting flight to Barcelona, completing our round trip ticket. We wanted to see Madrid.</p>

<p>Well, the security guard refused to let us take our luggage on the plane. After pleading with him, we went to the Iberia office, Pram worked his magic on them, and they gave us tags for our luggage so that we could carry them on. We returned to the guard and he began lecturing us when we showed him our tags. he had to let us through.</p>

<p>Everything is going according to plan.</p>

    <td>We will spend four nights in Madrid, then I will fly home to New York and Pram will return to Amsterdam to continue his travels. Although Madrid is a larger city, I preferred Barcelona to Madrid. I felt there was more cultural richness in Barcelona. However, Madrid, with a population twice as large as Barcelona, has the critical mass to foster an energetic, bustling feeling on the streets. Since there are very few bars and clubs in Morocco, we were back on our schedule of sight-seeing and Spanish nightlife.</td>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After cleaning up, we went out for a walk. Pram was shopping in Zara, and I was frustrated that none of the clothes were made for people like me.</p>

<p>I let Pram continue shopping while I went for a walk. I walked around this area and passed a cutie on the street. Our eyes met, but we kept walking.</p>

<p>About 10 minutes later, we passed one another again and our eyes met again. This time we stopped and began talking to one another. We talked as best we could and then went to the El Corte Ingles and chatted over a fresh orange juice.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pram and I went out last night. I believe I was home by 3 or 4 o'clock; he was back well after sun-up. While he slept, I got myself ready to see some sights. Tonight I was planning to see Felipe, but this afternoon I will see a few other attractions in Madrid.</p>

<p>I walked over to the Plaza Mayor, then to the Royal Palace, and finally over to the parks surrounding the Prado Museum. It is blisteringly hot--it must be around 100 degrees--and the Sun is strong.</p>

<p>He had friends coming over around 8:30, and I was going to meet them. I felt a little awkward about this, but I just rolled with the punches. After they arrived, I took a walk with Felipe and we said our goodbyes.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pram and I headed out about 10 PM and began the evening at this bar called Truco in La Chueca. Think of a Spanish version of a pub and this is it. Most of the people, including ourselves, mingle and talk on the small sidewalk surrounding the bar. Only occasionally do people get clipped by passing cars on the narrow Calle de Gravina. We were here for about an hour and met many nice people. An nice Argentine latched on to us and we ended up going to get some sushi with him before going to the Liquid bar.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After some sushi, we got a drink at Liquid Bar. This is a trendy, popular bar that is packed with people. Madrid does have a bit of a herd mentality, so everyone goes to one bar between 10 and midnight, then they all trickle into another bar between midnight and 3, then it's a disco after that.</p>
			
<p>Within a few minutes, I looked across the bar and standing about 10 feet away was none other than Felipe. He was with his friends so I went over to say hi for a minute. How wonderful to see him one last time.</p>

<p>The place was hopping and the music was good. I was thankful that the bass was not so high as to rattle my innards around like some clubs in New York. Pram introduced me to a few people he met the night before while I continued to guzzle the vodka y limons.</p>

<p>By about 6 AM, I decided to head home. Miraculously, I was able to find my way back to the hostel. To my surprise, Pram was already in bed.</p>

			<name>Royal Botanical Garden</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.rjb.csic.es/infov_eng.php">Royal Botanical Gardens</a> were started in 1755 and contain more than 30,000 species. Many from Asia, the Near East, and a few from America. Locust trees seemed to be exciting enough to bring back from North America. Many cacti too. This is a statue of a botanist whose name escapes me. This shot would have benefited from a telephoto lens.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Winnie the Pooh and a TeleTubby too. It's nearly 100 degrees and here are these costumed characters out for euros. I can't image how hot they are. This is the Central Park of Madrid. Large lakes, fountains, and beautifully landscaped walks. Not as "wild" as Central Park, more stately in its appearance.</p>

			<name>Writing in the Grass</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It was heading toward early evening and it was still hot out. I decided to lie in the grass and work on my journal and cool off. I soon realized that this was where the drug dealers hang out. One of them come over to talk, but I kept my distance. he seemed like a nice guy, not like the dealers we have in the states. And, he got my message land left me alone. He was probably just trying to see who I was.</p>

			<name>Prado Museum</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I went to bed early last night so I could spend some time seeing the some art on my last day before returning to New York. The Prado was established in 1818 and is one of the finest art museums in the world. It is also huge. I arrived a little before 10 AM, and I would have to breeze through it to see the other museums I would like to see today.</p>
			
<p>This rendition of Castor and Pollux was sculpted in the first century A.D.</p>

<p><img src="http://brianabbott.net/travels/spainmorocco/photos/ABBOTT0-R6-031-14.jpg" width="294" height="450" alt="Castor and Pollux" /></p>

<p>Depiction of the creation of the Milky Way, this was one of several breast-spraying paintings in the Prado. The more disturbing showed a holy man receiving milk from Mary (I think) as he was kneeling on the floor. How sexual is that?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The flight home was smooth. We took off at 11 AM from Madrid and landed at JFK at 1 PM, with a 5-hour time zone difference. My trip was coming to an end, and I was mighty sad. I had a wonderful time on my first trip abroad. I hope to fly over an ocean again very soon.</p>
