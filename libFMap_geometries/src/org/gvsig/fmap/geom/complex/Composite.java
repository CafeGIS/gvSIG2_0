 * A geometric composite shall be a geometric complex with an underlying core 
 * geometry that is isomorphic to a primitive. Thus, a composite curve is 
 * a collection of curves whose geometry interface could be satisfied 
 * by a single curve (albeit a much more complex one). 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Composites are intended for use as attribute values in datasets in 
 * which the underlying geometry has been decomposed, usually to expose its topological nature.
