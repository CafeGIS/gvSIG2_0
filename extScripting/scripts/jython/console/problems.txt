==========================
Known problems
==========================

You must use the keyboard not the mouse to select methods.  (Due to focus problems.)

python.security.respectJavaAccessibility must be set to true in Jython's registry

You can't insert '(' and ')' in the middle of a line

Method popup displays names multiple times for overloaded methods

Method popup gets abandoned with too many backspaces.  (Use <ESC> to make it go away)

Builtin types don't work, like they do in PyCrust.  This is because they have a null __doc__ string in Jython.

Static methods and properties don't seem to work correctly.

<CTRL>+D (or <CRTL>+Z) to exit is not implemented

History doesn't quite work correctly
